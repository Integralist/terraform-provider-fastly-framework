## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The unique name for the service to create

### Optional

- `activate` (Boolean) Conditionally prevents the Service from being activated. The apply step will continue to create a new draft version but will not activate it if this is set to `false`. Default `true`
- `comment` (String) Description field for the service. Default `Managed by Terraform`
- `domain` (Block Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--domain))
- `force` (Boolean) Services that are active cannot be destroyed. In order to destroy the service, set `force_destroy` to `true`. Default `false`
- `reuse` (Boolean) Services that are active cannot be destroyed. If set to `true` a service Terraform intends to destroy will instead be deactivated (allowing it to be reused by importing it into another Terraform project). If `false`, attempting to destroy an active service will cause an error. Default `false`

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Example identifier

<a id="nestedblock--domain"></a>
### Nested Schema for `domain`

Required:

- `name` (String) The domain that this service will respond to. It is important to note that changing this attribute will delete and recreate the resource

Optional:

- `comment` (String) An optional comment about the domain
